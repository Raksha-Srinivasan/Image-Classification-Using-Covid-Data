# Image-Classification-Using-Covid-Data

This project mainly aims in detecting the Covid-Cases from the given Pre-Trained Dataset using CNN Model.

# Dataset:
** http://cb.lk/covid_19 ** 

# Objective 
One of the critical factors behind the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic is a lengthy clinical testing time. The imaging tool, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), can speed up the identification process. Therefore, our objective is to develop an automated CAD system for the detecting COVID-19 samples from healthy and pneumonia cases using Chest-XRay images.
